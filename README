This is a first prototype of the IO library for the POLARIS project.

All of the dependencies for polaris_io are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/polaris-t/files/io_sdk.zip/download

There are a couple of places where you need to change paths: 
 * io.props
 * io_lib.props if you are planning to use the Transims2Polaris converter
 
 
I've tested the debug compilation only.

There is a custom compilation step whcih calls the odb.exe on the correspondding header file. 
Make sure that the file path is your PATH variable. The odb.exe is a part of the io_sdk

TODO:
	* Support for nested files
