This is a first prototype of the IO library for the POLARIS project.

All of the dependencies are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/polaris-t/files/io_sdk.zip/download

There are a couple of places where you need to change paths: 
 * The io.props
 * The polaris_io project properties -> debugging -> Environment
 
I've tested the debug compilation only.
